RXTX Project
============

Provides a bridge for RXTX to make it compatible with Java Comms API.
Not fully supported so far, just enough for x10, dmx, and audio projects to work.

Project contains the RXTX comm library (gnu.io.*) and PL2303 USB to serial drivers.

For MacOSX:
- Follow instructions under lib/macosx/pl2303 to install the serial usb driver
- Follow instructions under lib/macosx/rxtx to instal gnu rxtx library
- Comm port name should be "/dev/tty.usbserial" or similar
