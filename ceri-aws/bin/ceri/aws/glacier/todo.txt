TODO:
=====

- Write multipart downloader
- Use GlacierFiler to download and write to disk (for full and deltas)
- Create file filter based on path regex and modified date
- Figure out upload plan:
  - Decide on non-gzipped dirs (ceri/music)
  - Initial tar files
  - Delta tar files, based on write time to backup drive
  - Full upload once every 6 months?
  - Keep 2 copies at any one time
  - Test downloads once every few months
- Download plan
  - Untar/unzip on download
  
Strategy:
- use one vault per group per delta/full
- naming: <group>-<delta|full>-<yyyy.mm.dd>
  e.g. music-delta-2012.12.04
