Standard Command
----------------
PC         Device
2 bytes =>
        <= checksum
0 ack   =>
        <= 0x55 ready

1) Address command
  15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8 - 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0   <housecode> <devicecode>

2) Function command (no dim)
  15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8 - 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  0   <housecode> <funccode>

2) Function command (dim/bright)
  15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8 - 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
    <dim-level>  1  1  0   <housecode> <funccode>


Extended Command
----------------
PC         Device
4 bytes =>
        <= checksum
0 ack   =>
        <= 0x55 ready

  15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8 - 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1   <housecode> 0  1  1  1

  15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8 - 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
  <data>                   <command>


Data Poll
---------
PC         Device
        <= 0x5a 
   0xc3 =>      
        <= 2-10 bytes

On receiving data, the device will poll PC with 0x5a once per second.
PC sends ack 0xc3 to stop poll and initiate data receive.
Device sends 2-10 bytes:
  0 = buffer size (1-9)
  1 = up to 8 bits; function(1) or address(0) for next 8 bytes
  2-9 = data bytes: house:unit, house:func, house:func;dim, or house:func;data;command


Set Clock
---------
PC         Device
        <= 0xa5
7 bytes => 
 
Device can send 0xa5 set clock request when it detects a power loss.
PC should reply, but can also send at any time:
  0 = set clock header 0x9b
  1 = seconds
  2 = minutes 0-119
  3 = hours/2 0-11
  4 = year day
  5 = year day (1 bit), day mask 
  6 = house:flags

  
Get Status
----------
PC         Device
   0x8b =>
        <= 14 bytes

PC can send 0x8b to request the device status.
Device returns immediately with 14 bytes:
  0-1 = battery timer / reset
  2 = seconds
  3 = minutes 0-119
  4 = hours/2 0-11
  5 = year day
  6 = year day (1 bit), day mask
  7 = house:firmware
  8-9 = address devices (16 bits)
  10-11 = on/off status (16 bits)
  12-13 = dim status (16 bits)
