      <subsection name="Common Notes">
        <p>The stream classes all wrap around streams provided by the
          calling code and they work on them directly without any
          additional buffering.  On the other hand most of them will
          benefit from buffering so it is highly recommended that
          users wrap their stream
          in <code>Buffered<em>(In|Out)</em>putStream</code>s before
          using the Commons Compress API.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Factories">

        <p>Compress provides factory methods to create input/output
          streams based on the names of the compressor or archiver
          format as well as factory methods that try to guess the
          format of an input stream.</p>

        <p>To create a compressor writing to a given output by using
          the algorithm name:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
CompressorOutputStream gzippedOut = new CompressorStreamFactory()
    .createCompressorOutputStream(CompressorStreamFactory.GZIP, myOutputStream);
]]></source>

        <p>Make the factory guess the input format for a given stream:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
ArchiveInputStream input = new ArchiveStreamFactory()
    .createArchiveInputStream(originalInput);
]]></source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Unsupported Features">
        <p>Many of the supported formats have developed different
        dialects and extensions and some formats allow for features
        (not yet) supported by Commons Compress.</p>

        <p>The <code>ArchiveInputStream</code> class provides a method
        <code>canReadEntryData</code> that will return false if
        Commons Compress can detect that an archive uses a feature
        that is not supported by the current implementation.  If it
        returns false you should not try to read the entry but skip
        over it.</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Concatenated Streams">
        <p>For the bzip2, gzip and xz formats a single compressed file
        may actually consist of several streams that will be
        concatenated by the command line utilities when decompressing
        them.  Starting with Commons Compress 1.4 the
        <code>*CompressorInputStream</code>s for these formats support
        concatenating streams as well, but they won't do so by
        default.  You must use the two-arg constructor and explicitly
        enable the support.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="ar">

        <p>In addition to the information stored
          in <code>ArchiveEntry</code> a <code>ArArchiveEntry</code>
          stores information about the owner user and group as well as
          Unix permissions.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to an ar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ArArchiveEntry entry = new ArArchiveEntry(name, size);
arOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
arOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
arOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an ar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ArArchiveEntry entry = (ArArchiveEntry) arInput.getNextEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    arInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>

        <p>Traditionally the AR format doesn't allow file names longer
          than 16 characters.  There are two variants that circumvent
          this limitation in different ways, the GNU/SRV4 and the BSD
          variant.  Commons Compress 1.0 to 1.2 can only read archives
          using the GNU/SRV4 variant, support for the BSD variant has
          been added in Commons Compress 1.3.  Commons Compress 1.3
          also optionally supports writing archives with file names
          longer than 16 characters using the BSD dialect, writing
          the SVR4/GNU dialect is not supported.</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="cpio">

        <p>In addition to the information stored
          in <code>ArchiveEntry</code> a <code>CpioArchiveEntry</code>
          stores various attributes including information about the
          original owner and permissions.</p>

        <p>The cpio package supports the "new portable" as well as the
          "old" format of CPIO archives in their binary, ASCII and
          "with CRC" variants.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a cpio archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
CpioArchiveEntry entry = new CpioArchiveEntry(name, size);
cpioOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
cpioOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
cpioOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an cpio archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
CpioArchiveEntry entry = cpioInput.getNextCPIOEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    cpioInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="dump">

        <p>In addition to the information stored
          in <code>ArchiveEntry</code> a <code>DumpArchiveEntry</code>
          stores various attributes including information about the
          original owner and permissions.</p>

        <p>As of Commons Compress 1.3 only dump archives using the
          new-fs format - this is the most common variant - are
          supported.  Right now this library supports uncompressed and
          ZLIB compressed archives and can not write archives at
          all.</p>

        <p>Reading entries from an dump archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
DumpArchiveEntry entry = dumpInput.getNextDumpEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    dumpInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="tar">

        <p>The TAR package has a <a href="tar.html">dedicated
            documentation page</a>.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a tar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
TarArchiveEntry entry = new TarArchiveEntry(name);
entry.setSize(size);
tarOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
tarOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
tarOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an tar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
TarArchiveEntry entry = tarInput.getNextTarEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    tarInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="zip">
        <p>The ZIP package has a <a href="zip.html">dedicated
            documentation page</a>.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a zip archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ZipArchiveEntry entry = new ZipArchiveEntry(name);
entry.setSize(size);
zipOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
zipOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
zipOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p><code>ZipArchiveOutputStream</code> can use some internal
          optimizations exploiting <code>RandomAccessFile</code> if it
          knows it is writing to a file rather than a non-seekable
          stream.  If you are writing to a file, you should use the
          constructor that accepts a <code>File</code> argument rather
          than the one using an <code>OutputStream</code> or the
          factory method in <code>ArchiveStreamFactory</code>.</p>

        <p>Reading entries from an zip archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ZipArchiveEntry entry = zipInput.getNextZipEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    zipInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an zip archive using the
          recommended <code>ZipFile</code> class:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ZipArchiveEntry entry = zipFile.getEntry(name);
InputStream content = zipFile.getInputStream(entry);
try {
    READ UNTIL content IS EXHAUSTED
} finally {
    content.close();
}
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="jar">
        <p>In general, JAR archives are ZIP files, so the JAR package
          supports all options provided by the ZIP package.</p>

        <p>To be interoperable JAR archives should always be created
          using the UTF-8 encoding for file names (which is the
          default).</p>

        <p>Archives created using <code>JarArchiveOutputStream</code>
          will implicitly add a <code>JarMarker</code> extra field to
          the very first archive entry of the archive which will make
          Solaris recognize them as Java archives and allows them to
          be used as executables.</p>

        <p>Note that <code>ArchiveStreamFactory</code> doesn't
          distinguish ZIP archives from JAR archives, so if you use
          the one-argument <code>createArchiveInputStream</code>
          method on a JAR archive, it will still return the more
          generic <code>ZipArchiveInputStream</code>.</p>

        <p>The <code>JarArchiveEntry</code> class contains fields for
          certificates and attributes that are planned to be supported
          in the future but are not supported as of Compress 1.0.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a jar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
JarArchiveEntry entry = new JarArchiveEntry(name, size);
entry.setSize(size);
jarOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
jarOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
jarOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an jar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
JarArchiveEntry entry = jarInput.getNextJarEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    jarInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="bzip2">

        <p>Note that <code>BZipCompressorOutputStream</code> keeps
          hold of some big data structures in memory.  While it is
          true recommended for any stream that you close it as soon as
          you no longer needed, this is even more important
          for <code>BZipCompressorOutputStream</code>.</p>

        <p>Uncompressing a given bzip2 compressed file (you would
          certainly add exception handling and make sure all streams
          get closed properly):</p>

BufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(fin);

          the <code>java.util.zip</code> package of the Java class
          library.</p>

        <p>Uncompressing a given gzip compressed file (you would
