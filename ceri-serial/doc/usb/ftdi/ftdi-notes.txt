MPSSE (Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine)

Allows FT232H chip to speak many different protocols such as I2C, SPI, and more.
When the chip is in MPSSE mode it changes the D0 to D3 pins to have special
serial protocol functions:

D0 - Clock signal output.  This line can be configured as a clock that runs
     at speeds between ~450Hz to 30Mhz.
D1 - Serial data output.  This is for outputting a serial signal, like the MOSI line
     in a SPI connection.
D2 - Serial data input.  This is for reading a serial signal, like the MISO line
     in a SPI connection.
D3 - Serial select signal.  This is a chip select or chip enable signal to tell
     a connected device that the FT232H is ready to talk to it.

In addition to the serial protocol pins above, the MPSSE mode allows you to control
other pins as general purpose digital inputs or outputs.  These are great for controlling
chip select, reset, or other lines on chips.  You can even use the GPIO to read switches,
blink LEDs, and more!
